Master these 8 JavaScript performance strategies to crack any frontend interviews .

𝟭. 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
Garbage Collection: Keep track of unnecessary objects and avoid memory leaks.
𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗩𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀: Use let and const to manage memory more effectively.
𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Use Maps and Sets for faster lookups than arrays in large datasets.
𝗪𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀: Consider using WeakMap and WeakSet for objects that don't need to persist in memory.

𝟮. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Instead of attaching event listeners to each element, attach one to the parent and let events bubble up.
Tip: Use event delegation in list items, buttons, and dynamically created/modified elements.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁: Reduces the number of event listeners, improving performance especially in large DOMs.

𝟯. 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀
Use async/await and Promises to prevent blocking the event loop and manage concurrency efficiently.
Tip: Avoid callback hell and use Promise.all or Promise.allSettled to handle multiple async tasks simultaneously.
𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗨𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀: Don’t overuse async/await where synchronous code will do the job.

𝟰. 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴
Use debouncing for high-frequency events like input or scroll to limit function calls.
𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Useful when you want to execute a function at a set interval, such as during scrolling or resize events.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁: Reduces the number of function calls in high-frequency events.

𝟱. 𝗟𝗮𝘇𝘆 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
Lazy Load resources such as images or data to improve page load times.
𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Split your JavaScript into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed (e.g., with React.lazy or webpack).
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁: Reduces the initial load time by loading only essential resources.

𝟲. 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀
Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations that trigger repaints and reflows.
Batch DOM updates, and avoid using inline styles or frequent layout changes.

𝟳. 𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Cache expensive calculations, API responses, or DOM lookups using variables or libraries like localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB.
Tip: Implement Memoization for functions that return the same result for the same inputs.

𝟴. 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀
Use for or forEach for looping, but avoid the for...in loop for arrays as it’s slower.
𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗡𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀: Try to minimize nested loops or break early when possible to avoid unnecessary iterations.
