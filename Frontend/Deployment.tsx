Which one might deploy faster when deploying React (CRA or Vite) and Next.js apps?


| Factor                       | **React (CRA/Vite)**                            | **Next.js**                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build Time**               | Usually **faster** (especially with Vite)       | Usually **slower** (due to server-side rendering, etc.) |
| **Output**                   | Static files (HTML/CSS/JS)                      | Static + Server-rendered (SSR/ISR functions)            |
| **Hosting Type**             | Pure static (CDN-ready)                         | Needs server or edge function runtime for SSR           |
| **Deployment Target**        | Can be hosted on any static host (e.g. Netlify) | Needs special handling for SSR on Netlify/Vercel/etc.   |
| **Overall Deployment Speed** | **Usually faster**                              | **Slightly slower** (due to complexity)                 |

### **So, who will deploy faster?**

* **React (especially Vite)** will **deploy faster** than Next.js **in most cases**, because:

  * It just builds static files.
  * No server-side functions need to be created or deployed.

* **Next.js** takes a bit longer due to:

  * Server-side logic (e.g., `getServerSideProps`, API routes).
  * More steps in the build and deploy pipeline (especially for SSR or ISR).

### âœ… When Next.js might be just as fast:

* If your Next.js app is **fully static** (i.e., using `getStaticProps` everywhere), and you **disable server functions**, 
  then the speed difference is negligible.
